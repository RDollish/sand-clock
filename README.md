# Sand Clock

# Work In Progress - Not currently functional.

# Introduction
Traditional timers often rely on digital or analog displays to count down time, but the Sand Clock takes a different approach by simulating an hourglass with sand particles. This project was created to offer an alternative, visually appealing, and interactive timer experience.

The Sand Clock is implemented using React for the user interface and Matter.js, a 2D physics engine, to simulate the behavior of falling sand particles. When the timer starts, the sand particles gracefully flow from the upper chamber to the lower chamber, creating a captivating visual effect.

# Features
Interactive UI: The Hourglass Timer provides buttons to start, pause, and reset the timer, enhancing user control and interaction.

Dynamic Sand Simulation: Sand particles realistically fall under the influence of gravity, creating a captivating visual effect.

Customizable Timer: Users can set the desired timer duration, and the hourglass will visually represent the countdown.

Technologies
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Matter.js: A 2D physics engine that simulates physical interactions between objects, used for the sand particle simulation.

# Usage
Set the desired timer duration in seconds using the input field.

Click the "Start" button to begin the timer. The sand particles will start falling.

You can pause the timer at any time by clicking the "Pause" button.

To reset the timer, click the "Reset" button.
